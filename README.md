# Yggdrasil Interstellar Arcologies 
 A mod (early alpha) for KSP v1.7.3 which aims to offer players the ability to build functional kilometer-scale colony vessels of a realistic and physically tenable variety.   

Note that the current version uses a different name in its root folder.  This will be rectified in the near future.
